        <H3>... a GPS-to-Bluetooth program from <A HREF="https://www.outerworldapps.com">Outer World Apps</A>.</H3>

        <P>Putting a tablet in one's lap while flying can result in loss of GPS signal.
            This can be fixed by placing a phone in a location within the aircraft that has a
            better view of the sky, which receives the GPS signal, then relays the co-ordinates
            to the tablet via bluetooth.</P>

        <P>The bluetooth messages are in industry standard NMEA format of types GGA, GSA, GSV, RMC
            (the minimal set needed to convey latitude, longitude, altitude, course, speed,
            date, time, satellites).  They are known to work with EFB apps
            <A HREF="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outerworldapps.wairtonow">WairToNow</A>
            and <A HREF="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ds.avare">Avare</A>.
            It probably works with others.</P>

        <P>The GPSBlue app normally runs in the background.  This is indicated by the small
            icon in the notifications bar at the top of the Android screen, no matter which
            app if any happens to be open:</P>
            <IMG SRC="notificationbar_w_circle.png">
        <P>Whenever nothing is connected to it,
            it shuts down GPS reception and waits for a bluetooth connection.  Whenever
            something is connected, it starts
            GPS reception and forwards the GPS information to whatever has connected (it can
            handle multiple connections).</P>

        <P>Running the GPSBlue app itself opens a user interface which gives the user control
            over the background task via the <IMG SRC="menubutton.png" WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=22>
            menu buttons:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI><B>Close UI</B> - closes the user interface but leaves the background task
                running if is running
            <LI><B>Start BT</B> - starts the background task if not running
            <LI><B>Stop BT</B> - stops the background task if it is running (no effect if
                not)
            <LI><B>Help</B> - display this page
            <LI><B>Home</B> - go back to home screen
        </UL>

        <P>The app and background task require that the Android device have both Bluetooth
            and GPS enabled in the device's Settings.  If not, the background task will
            terminate and the UI will open and display an error message.</P>

        <P>If the background task fails to start even with Bluetooth and GPS enabled, you may
            need to try a different UUID.  The default is
            <TT>00001101-1000-8000-0000-00805F9B34FB</TT> so try changing the
            <TT>00001101</TT> to <TT>00001102</TT> etc (must be exactly 8 hexadecimal digits).
            You will have to tell the EFB app to use the different UUID.</P>

        <P>The device running the EFB app only needs Bluetooth enabled.  And it needs to be
            paired using its Bluetooth control found in the Android device's Settings.</P>

        <P>It is recommended that WiFi be turned off on all devices when using them in flight
            to conserve battery.</P>

        <H3>Common causes of connection failure</H3>

        <P>If the EFB app is unable to connect to GPSBlue while the GPSBlue device's screen
            is dark, just press its power button to light up the screen and try again.  It
            may be that the phone has gone into deep sleep and so needs waking up.  Once
            connected, the phone screen will be allowed to shut off to save battery, but
            the GPS-to-bluetooth connection will still function.</P>

        <P>If the EFB app is unable to connect to GPSBlue with the GPSBlue device's screen
            lit up, verify the background task is running by looking for the GPSBlue icon
            in the notifications bar.  Swipe down to see if there is an error message listed
            with the notification.  You can restart the background task by opening the app
            then doing <B>Stop BT</B> then <B>Start BT</B> from the menu.</P>
            <IMG SRC="bluetooth_error.png">

        <P>Also make sure the UUID in GPSBlue matches the UUID used by the EFB app.</P>
